# Claude Template Migration (Content Strategist)

Normalize each legacy template to:
1. Purpose
2. Required inputs
3. Fixed output sections
4. KPI mapping (primary + guardrail)
5. Owner + due date fields
6. Scale/iterate/stop threshold

## Migration Input Block
- Original template name:
- Current use case:
- Existing sections:
- Missing measurable fields:
- Desired cadence (weekly/monthly):

## Conversion Rules
- Preserve original voice and strategic intent.
- Replace vague language with measurable targets.
- Remove duplicate sections and overlapping prompts.
- Force owner, due date, and KPI fields.
