## Lead-focused message (for lead/anchor checks)
Subject: Credo OS — operating layer for enterprise AI, raising $500k

Hi {{Name}},  
Warm intro via {{IntroPath}}.  
We are building Credo OS, an operating layer for enterprise AI workflows (not a model wrapper): Goal -> Graph -> Roles -> Validation -> Traceability.

Current status:
- MVP with active users (verification pack ready),
- Web EN/RU + Telegram WebApp surface,
- clear governance and quality control architecture.

We are raising **$500k** at **$5M pre** and are looking for a lead/anchor who can help shape syndicate quality, not only provide capital.

Would you be open to a 25-minute diligence call this week?

Best,  
{{Founder}}

## Follower/syndicate message
Subject: Credo OS syndicate round ($500k)

Hi {{Name}},  
Reaching out through {{IntroPath}}. We are opening a syndicate round for Credo OS (enterprise AI operating layer).

What is unique:
- deterministic orchestration and mandatory quality gates,
- governance-first approach for business risk control,
- practical product surface already in MVP.

Round terms: **$500k at $5M pre**.  
If useful, I can send the 12-slide deck + data room summary.

Open to a short call this week?

Best,  
{{Founder}}
